Overview
-------------
Due to its numerous applications, e.g., in cartography, geographic information systems, point pattern analysis, spatial statistics, and graphical interfaces, automated map labeling attracts still many researchers in computer science. A major problem in map labeling is the point-feature label placement problem, where the task is to place labels adjacent to point-features so that only a few or no labels overlap. The growing amount of data leads to an increasing need for fast and efficient map labeling algorithms that produce well readable labelings in a small amount of time.

We present a new and very efficient heuristical approach in the most general of the labeling models, the four-slider model. This page offers access to a number of test instances and a demo application to compare our method to other known algorithms in the four-slider and four-position model. The application has been developed using Java and can be obtained in the download section. Furthermore this sections enables access to a Technical Report, which describes the algorithm and contains a large section of computational results.

sample labeling

Sample labeling of 910/1041 point features. Red points mark labels that could not be placed without intersections.
